# Testing Automated Article Generation

This is a test article to verify that our automated article page generation system works correctly. When adding new articles, you should now only need to:

1. Create a new Markdown file in the `content/articles` directory
2. Add proper frontmatter (metadata)
3. Write your article content

The system will automatically:

- Generate a properly formatted article page
- Create appropriate metadata and SEO information
- Generate schema.org structured data
- Make the article available at `/articles/[slug]`

## How It Works

The dynamic routing system uses Next.js's dynamic routes feature to:

1. Scan the `content/articles` directory for Markdown files
2. Create routes for each article using the filename as the slug
3. Parse the Markdown content and metadata
4. Apply the article template

## Benefits

- **Time Saving**: No need to create individual page files
- **Consistency**: All articles use the same template and layout
- **Maintenance**: Update the template once to affect all articles
- **SEO**: Proper schema generation and metadata for all articles automatically

This makes the content creation workflow much more efficient!
