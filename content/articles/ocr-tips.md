# Advanced OCR Tips and Tricks

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a powerful technology that can extract text from images. While Cavcount makes this process easy, there are some tips and tricks to get even better results.

## Image Quality Matters

The quality of your image significantly affects OCR accuracy:

- **High resolution** images produce better results
- **Good lighting** ensures text is clearly visible
- **Minimal background noise** helps the OCR focus on text

## Text Formatting

The way text is formatted in your image also matters:

- **Clean fonts** are easier to recognize than decorative ones
- **Black text on white background** works best
- **Avoid overlapping text** or text on complex backgrounds

## Post-Processing

After extracting text with OCR:

- Always review the extracted text for accuracy
- Fix any obvious errors
- Check for formatting issues
- Verify numbers and special characters

By following these tips, you can significantly improve the accuracy of OCR results in Cavcount!
